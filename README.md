# artinsituteAPI_hackathon

Description:
This is a React.js project that uses a public API from the Art Institute Chicago (https://api.artic.edu/docs/#introduction) to pull information about artworks in the museum collection. The project displays a landing page that allows the user access to a list of 100 artworks (images and titles). If the user clicks on an individual artwork, they are brought to a page that includes the Image, artwork title, artist name, and artwork date.
